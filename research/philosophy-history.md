## 3 Main Problems of Philosophy

### What Am I?
The Problem of Knowledge. What kind of being am I?

### How Should I Behave?
The Problem of Conduct.  What kind of life should I strive for?

### How Should I Be Governed?
The Problem of Governance. How should my community work?

## The Beginning (6th Century BC)
Philosophy seems to have really begun with the Greeks, and this was mostly because there was an advanced civilization that didn't have an official religion and thus left some reason for questioning.  They just lost a major war and started to reflect on themselves "Where did we go wrong to lose?"

### Pythagoras (580 - 500 BC)
* "Reality is abstract and relational, depending on numbers"
* He was really big on numbers, considering them divine.
  * Specifically the _tetraktys_ (the sacred integers) being 1 (a point), 2 (a line), 3 (a plane), and 4 (a solid)
* Also big on music, and known for the harmonic scale
  * Music's harmonious relationship with people not coincidentally also a numbered scale
* Clearly most famous for Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)

### Metaphysics
* **Metaphysics**: "after the study of science"
  * **Ontology** Beyond the science of things: What is there?
  * **Epistemology**: study, criticism, and refinement of what it means to know something: How do we know?
  * These 2 branches of metaphysics are very much bound together
* **Atomists** There is a ultimate level of physical reality that nothing goes below (atomic, you can't break it down further)

### Socrates (496 - 406 BC)
* Famous for questioning the most confident of people about why they were so confidence and pointing out the flaws in their thinking
* Chose to die after his trial (corrupting youth) rather than flee and go against what he believed in: laws are important
* "Allegory of the Cave"
  * Prisoner's in a Cave with shadows projected on a wall being their reality (Plato's Republic)
* To get anywhere, first must defeat skepticism and cynicism (who say we can't know anything for sure)
  * Find a root kernel of truth to show we can know something which can lead us to tackling the 3 main problems (ourselves, conduct, governance)

### Plato (427 - 347 BC)
* Prominent student of Socrates (often arguments about who was the real mind, Socrates vs Plato)
* _Meno_
  * Story of Meno's slave who seemed to understand concepts of pythagorean theorem without ever having studied it
  * Proof that there is an absolute knowledge beyond what we are taught
* Idea of "ideal" triange which doesn't exist in reality
  * What is it about the "soul" that lets us connect to that kind of ideal truth when the triangles we observe are never that perfect triangle?  Why do we all know about something like that and understand it?
* Thus, Mathematics were great evidence of an absolute truth beyond man, one that could always be true and thus could be known
  * A strong position against skepticism
