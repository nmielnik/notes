## 3 Main Problems of Philosophy

### What Am I?
The Problem of Knowledge. What kind of being am I?

### How Should I Behave?
The Problem of Conduct.  What kind of life should I strive for?

### How Should I Be Governed?
The Problem of Governance. How should my community work?

## The Beginning (6th Century BC)
Philosophy seems to have really begun with the Greeks, and this was mostly because there was an advanced civilization that didn't have an official religion and thus left some reason for questioning.  They just lost a major war and started to reflect on themselves "Where did we go wrong to lose?"

### Pythagoras (580 - 500 BC)
* "Reality is abstract and relational, depending on numbers"
* He was really big on numbers, considering them divine.
  * Specifically the _tetraktys_ (the sacred integers) being 1 (a point), 2 (a line), 3 (a plane), and 4 (a solid)
* Also big on music, and known for the harmonic scale
  * Music's harmonious relationship with people not coincidentally also a numbered scale
* Clearly most famous for Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)

### Metaphysics
* **Metaphysics**: "after the study of science"
  * **Ontology** Beyond the science of things: What is there?
  * **Epistemology**: study, criticism, and refinement of what it means to know something: How do we know?
  * These 2 branches of metaphysics are very much bound together
* **Atomists** There is a ultimate level of physical reality that nothing goes below (atomic, you can't break it down further)

### Socrates (496 - 406 BC)
* Famous for questioning the most confident of people about why they were so confidence and pointing out the flaws in their thinking
* Chose to die after his trial (corrupting youth) rather than flee and go against what he believed in: laws are important
* "Allegory of the Cave"
  * Prisoner's in a Cave with shadows projected on a wall being their reality (Plato's Republic)
* To get anywhere, first must defeat skepticism and cynicism (who say we can't know anything for sure)
  * Find a root kernel of truth to show we can know something which can lead us to tackling the 3 main problems (ourselves, conduct, governance)

### Plato (427 - 347 BC)
* Prominent student of Socrates (often arguments about who was the real mind, Socrates vs Plato)
* _Meno_
  * Story of Meno's slave who seemed to understand concepts of pythagorean theorem without ever having studied it
  * Proof that there is an absolute knowledge beyond what we are taught
* Idea of "ideal" triange which doesn't exist in reality
  * What is it about the "soul" that lets us connect to that kind of ideal truth when the triangles we observe are never that perfect triangle?  Why do we all know about something like that and understand it?
* Thus, Mathematics were great evidence of an absolute truth beyond man, one that could always be true and thus could be known
  * A strong position against skepticism


## Elizabethans (Post Renaissance)

### Fancis Bacon (1562 - 1626)
* Thought as a "prophet" to Newton
* _Novum Organum_ - "New Method" - Ultimately saying we should move on from Aristotle, using what has been shown to us and advancing it forward
* Most famous for "Baconian Fact Gathering" - simple "light-shedding" experiments simply to measure the impact of A on B
* Began to hint at going out in the world to look at things and not just thinking about it from afar
* Talked of science for things like "human philosolphy" (aka Psychology)
* Began Empiricism - slow, deliberate, scientific analysis of the mind & society

### Rene Descartes (1596 - 1650)
* Some say modern philosophy began with him, as the founder of analytical geometry and contributions to optics and physiology
* Wanted a mathematics-like method for approaching philosophy, which didn't even have core principles all could agree on
* "I think, therefore I am" was his core axiom upon which everything was built
  * If nothing else, I can always be sure that I am at least a "thinking being" capable of thought
* _Discourse on Method_
  1. "Accept nothing as true except what presents itself with a clarity and vividness that is irresistible."
  2. "Divide each problem into as many smaller steps as possible."
  3. "Work from the solution of the smallest problem to the solution of problems of greater complexity."
  4. "Test the general solution with persistence, assuring yourself that it suffers from no exceptions."
* The mind is able to move the body, but how?  There are little hyrdalic systems, but how does the mind work them?
* If we made some sort of AI, it could never conceive of God, understand abstract math, or use language in a creative way.
  * Thus, there must be some innate knowledge which we are not taught.
* Introduced a systemic, repeatable approach to analyzing ourselves

### Isaac Newton (1642 - 1727)
* Started a revolution in how we used science to view our world
* Universal gravitation, movement of heavinly bodies, density of the Earth, trajectory of comets, mass of the sun.
* Motions of the tides, centripetal force, and theory of how something could be in orbit.
* Linked mathematics to physics for the first time, and shared discovery of Calculus with Leibniz
* Introduce the concept of "an ideal model" as a way to analyze and compare to real world phenomenom
  * Called the difference between truth and approximations "hypotheses"
* Put the world on the path of using science and models to break down any problem and analyze any occurance

### Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679)
* Secretary to Francis Bacon, later met Galileo which lead him to want to apply "new science" of mechanics to social & political world
* Wrote _Leviathan_ in 1651 about free will, determination, and nature of human nature
  * Controversial and faced many disputes
* Society can be scientifically analyzed, but must identify absurdities
  * Abuses in language like metaphors and saying not-real things are real (ie "infusing faith" - we can't actually infuse faith in someone)
* Human motion is either reflexive (react) or intentional
* We move intentionally toward pleasure and away from pain
  * "Good" and "Evil" have meaning, just rooted in pleasure and pain
* Our fear of a violent death leads us to society
* We are roughly equal, but the combination of others can always overtake us, so we need someone to protect us
  * This leads us to put faith/power in a being to protect us from the others - a _Leviathan_ aka "The State"
  * Our faith in that lasts only as long as it's able to protect us from the rest of society as a whole
* Charity - based on self-preservation
  * Desire for honor or fear of reprisal
* Concord in the state is like health in the body - sedition is sickness
  * Sedition leads to civil war, civil war is death - it "kills" civic life
* Hobbes didn't like Descartes mind/body analysis for he felt human nature was part of nature and could be analyzed as such
* Hobbes view of behavior in a scientific way showed beginning of modern scientific "flavor"
  * Along with Newton this meant, for things to be credible, science has to back it up (even our minds)

### John Locke (1632 - 1704)
* _Essay Concerning Human Understanding_
* There are things we know _intuitively_ - something cannot both exist and not exist
* Some things are universally true but need to be shown/proven - _demonstrative knowledge_
* "Molyneaux Problem" - if someone blind since birth gets their vision, can they recognize anything?  "No" (says Locke)
* We notice when 2 things happen close to each other, if they happen frequently we start to associate them with each other
* 2 kinds of experience: primary & secondary
  * Primary: the shape or hardness of something
  * Secondary: a resulting experience like "color"
* 2 types of "essence": real essence and nominal essence
  * We can't know "real essence" of something cuz it's too fundamental (ie atoms)
  * The associations we make with stuff from our perceptions creates "nominal essence"
* This had lots of holes (couldn't punish a man for his crime since he's not the same guy anymore) but it's moving thought forward

### Materialism (Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646 â€“ 1716) & George Berkeley (1685 - 1783))
* If you made a giant version of a person and went into the brain, you would never actually see a "thought"
* You can say "nothing is in the mind that wasn't first in the senses"...except for the intellect itself, the thing that perceives and processes the senses
* Berkeley: There is no material world, only what appears in our head
  * ie: If the tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?  Berkeley: No! And there is not tree either unless someone perceives it!

### David Hume (1711 - 1776)
* Before his _Treatise of Human Nature_ a few different British thoughts contributed to his thinking
  * Francis Hutcheson: humans act toward the greatest good for the greatest number of people
  * Bernard Mandeville: virtues come from people secretly just wanting personal gain
* What we have in our minds is just a copy of what the sense perceived
* Well before Darwin, he proposed natural selection where creates have traits that help them survive the best
* When A & B happen enough, they become linked at an instinctual level, causation is what mind associates as conjoined experiences
* Moral right and wrong are habitual associations and just stuff people made up, not an absolute truth
* Instinct still rules rationality, since our desire to survive and lean towards pleasure will always win out to ensure our survival

### Thomas Reid (1710 - 1796)
* More "common sense" view, where common sense is the basic facts we have to accept to get through our day
  * Caterpillar has to crawl over many leaves to find the one it can eat, just how it is
* Reid didn't buy the "copy" theory - if we just had copies, then our vision of stuff would be curved since our eyes are round inside
* Causation comes from us realizing we have our own "active power" where we can will things - a baby can put different things in its mouth or close its eyes to make the world dark
  * So, we reason that things we see were caused by some other power willing them to happen, just like ourselves
  * Causation isn't because we associate 2 things together - we don't think night causes day or vice versa
* We aren't just seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, otherwise we'd never take medicine that tastes like crap for our long term health
  * There's some rational, long term view that prevails
* We're not just a collection of copies of senses - forgetting an event in our past doesn't make us a different entity
  * Remembering Waterloo doesn't make us Napolean
* The "common sense" or "practiacl" view is important yet again
