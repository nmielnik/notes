# The Problem

### Each Difficult Coversation is really 3 conversations

#### The "What Happened" Coversation: _What's the story here?_
Who said what, who did what, who's right, who meant what, who's to blame.

##### The Truth Assumption
* I am right, you are wrong.
  * The quest to determine who is right is a dead end.
* Difficult conversations aren't about getting facts right, they're about conflicting perceptions, interpretations, and values.
  * Moving away from the truth assumption allows us to understand perception, interpretations, and values from both sides

##### The Intention Invention
The conversation about intentions - both yours and mine.
What I think your intentions are impact how I think about you and how the conversation goes.
We assume we know the other person's intentions when we don't.  We assume their intentions are bad more than we don't.
Intentions are complex and leaping to unfound assumptions can be a disaster.

##### The Blame Frame
Nobody wants to be blamed, so we just defend ourselves instead of having a productive conversation.
Example of kids arguing in back seat "She hit me" - "I hit her cuz she called me a baby"

#### The Feelings Conversation: _What should we do with our emotions?_
* Are my feelings valid, appropriate? Should I share them?
  * Bring up our feeings can be scary and make us vulnerable. What if they dismiss our feelings?
* What do I do about the other person's feelings
  * If we share ours, and they share theirs, are we up to listening to this?
* We tend to just skip this conversation

> Engaging in a difficult conversation without talking about feelings is like staging an opera without the music. Youâ€™ll get the plot but miss the point.

#### The Identity Conversation: _What does this say about me?_
* View of our self-image
* Am I competent or imcompetent? Am I a good person or bad?
* Example: We're asking for a raise
  * Seems like it's money, but it's about us
  * What if they say no?  What if they give us good reason why we don't deserve it?
* Example: Talking to neighbors about their dog
  * We view ourselves as good people
  * This could make us appear as mean or a troublemaker
* As you feel the implications on your self-image you may lose your balance
  * This can cause you to lose confidence or concentratio
  * In it's worst case we may feel paralyzed or overcome by panic

### Move Towards Learning Conversation
* Despite what we pretend, our intention is usually to deliver a message (prove a point, give them a piece of our mind)
* Instead of persuading to get your way:
  1. Learn other's perspective
  2. Explain your point of view
  3. Share and understand feelings
  4. Work together to find a way to manage the problem going forward
* There is always some piece of information the other person has that you don't

# Shift to a Learning Stance: _The "What Happened?" Conversation_

### Stop Arguing Over Who's Right: _Explore Each Other's Stories_

#### We Think They're The Problem
* **They're Selfish**: 
  * My gf won't go to couple conseling cuz it's too expensive. She doesn't care about me.
* **They're Irrational**:
  * Great Aunt Bertha sleeps on an old crappy mattress.
  * She's got terrible back problems but won't let Rory buy her a new mattress.
  * They say she's crazy and can't be reasoned with, I guess they're right (Rory)
* We persist in trying to help (aka change) them, but it leads to arguments

#### They Think We're The Problem
* Great Aunt Bertha
  * She likes the mattress cuz she shared it with her late husband
  * It's a safe haven and gives her control over her environment
  * She complains about her aches because she feels like it helps her connect with those around her
  * She thinks Rory can be a difficult person
  * She doesn't care what people think, and when Aunt Bertha tells her, she gets angry and unpleasant
* Rory thinks the problem is Aunt Bertha, Aunt Bertha thinks the problem is Rory

#### We Each Make Sense in Our Own Story
We make sense, but the other person also makes sense. 
We don't notice the ways in which our world differs from others.

#### Arguing Blocks Exploring
Arguing prevents us from seeing how the other person sees the world. 
Neither person makes sense in each other's worlds, so we dismiss each other's arguments.

#### Arguing Without Understand Doesn't Change Anything
People don't change without feeling understood, and arguing doesn't make people feel understood.

#### We See The World Differently
We each perceive different information and inteperate it differently.

##### We Have Different Information
###### We notice different things
Example: Doug & his nephew Andrew go to a parade
  * Andrew thinks it was a truck parade (Trucks pulling floats)
  * Doug notices the people on the floats
  * They both think they enjoyed _the_ parade (not the parade they each perceived)

###### We know ourselves better than anyone can
We each have circumstances and experiences the other can't know about (stress, values, intentions)

##### We Have Different Interpretations
###### We are influenced by our pasts
Every strong view you have has a lot to do with your previous experiences
Example: Celebratory Dinner
  * Person is complaining about how things are expensive, but it's free
  * They grew up during the depression and held on to that experience

###### We apply different rules
Our past causes us to develope "rules" we live by, following them without even knowing it. 
When our rules collid, there are problems.
Example: Business Trip - Meet in Lobby @ 7:00
  * One person shows up at 7:10, which pisses off the other person who then isn't able to focus
  * Other person notices and gets pissed off
  * One person thinks punctuality is critical - other think it's unprofessional to let something small affect ability to work

##### Our Conclusions are Self-Serving
We look for information that supports our conclusion, and convince ourselves it was right
"I sometimes failed to persuade the court I was right, but I never failed to persuade myself!"

#### Move From Certainty to Curiosity
"I wonder what information they have that I don't"

#### Embrace Both Stories: Adopt the "And Stance"
We usually either accept or reject the other person's stance since we think it means we have to abandon our own
Instead, we should embrace both stories/stances
Use "and" instead of "but" and string together both of your perceptions as correct
