# 1. The Problem

### Chapter 1: Each Difficult Coversation is really 3 conversations

#### The "What Happened" Coversation: _What's the story here?_
Who said what, who did what, who's right, who meant what, who's to blame.

##### The Truth Assumption
* I am right, you are wrong.
  * The quest to determine who is right is a dead end.
* Difficult conversations aren't about getting facts right, they're about conflicting perceptions, interpretations, and values.
  * Moving away from the truth assumption allows us to understand perception, interpretations, and values from both sides

##### The Intention Invention
* The conversation about intentions - both yours and mine.
* What I think your intentions are impact how I think about you and how the conversation goes.
* We assume we know the other person's intentions when we don't.  We assume their intentions are bad more than we don't.
* Intentions are complex and leaping to unfound assumptions can be a disaster.

##### The Blame Frame
* Nobody wants to be blamed, so we just defend ourselves instead of having a productive conversation.
* Example of kids arguing in back seat "She hit me" - "I hit her cuz she called me a baby"

#### The Feelings Conversation: _What should we do with our emotions?_
* Are my feelings valid, appropriate? Should I share them?
  * Bring up our feeings can be scary and make us vulnerable. What if they dismiss our feelings?
* What do I do about the other person's feelings
  * If we share ours, and they share theirs, are we up to listening to this?
* We tend to just skip this conversation

> Engaging in a difficult conversation without talking about feelings is like staging an opera without the music. You’ll get the plot but miss the point.

#### The Identity Conversation: _What does this say about me?_
* View of our self-image
* Am I competent or imcompetent? Am I a good person or bad?
* Example: We're asking for a raise
  * Seems like it's money, but it's about us
  * What if they say no?  What if they give us good reason why we don't deserve it?
* Example: Talking to neighbors about their dog
  * We view ourselves as good people
  * This could make us appear as mean or a troublemaker
* As you feel the implications on your self-image you may lose your balance
  * This can cause you to lose confidence or concentratio
  * In it's worst case we may feel paralyzed or overcome by panic

### Move Towards Learning Conversation
* Despite what we pretend, our intention is usually to deliver a message (prove a point, give them a piece of our mind)
* Instead of persuading to get your way:
  1. Learn other's perspective
  2. Explain your point of view
  3. Share and understand feelings
  4. Work together to find a way to manage the problem going forward
* There is always some piece of information the other person has that you don't



# 2. Shift to a Learning Stance: _The "What Happened?" Conversation_

### Chapter 2: Stop Arguing Over Who's Right: _Explore Each Other's Stories_

#### We Think They're The Problem
* **They're Selfish**: 
  * My gf won't go to couple conseling cuz it's too expensive. She doesn't care about me.
* **They're Irrational**:
  * Great Aunt Bertha sleeps on an old crappy mattress.
  * She's got terrible back problems but won't let Rory buy her a new mattress.
  * They say she's crazy and can't be reasoned with, I guess they're right (Rory)
* We persist in trying to help (aka change) them, but it leads to arguments

#### They Think We're The Problem
* Great Aunt Bertha
  * She likes the mattress cuz she shared it with her late husband
  * It's a safe haven and gives her control over her environment
  * She complains about her aches because she feels like it helps her connect with those around her
  * She thinks Rory can be a difficult person
  * She doesn't care what people think, and when Aunt Bertha tells her, she gets angry and unpleasant
* Rory thinks the problem is Aunt Bertha, Aunt Bertha thinks the problem is Rory

#### We Each Make Sense in Our Own Story
* We make sense, but the other person also makes sense.
* We don't notice the ways in which our world differs from others.

#### Arguing Blocks Exploring
* Arguing prevents us from seeing how the other person sees the world.
* Neither person makes sense in each other's worlds, so we dismiss each other's arguments.

#### Arguing Without Understand Doesn't Change Anything
* People don't change without feeling understood, and arguing doesn't make people feel understood.

#### We See The World Differently
* We each perceive different information and inteperate it differently.

##### We Have Different Information
###### We notice different things
* **Example:** Doug & his nephew Andrew go to a parade
  * Andrew thinks it was a truck parade (Trucks pulling floats)
  * Doug notices the people on the floats
  * They both think they enjoyed _the_ parade (not the parade they each perceived)

###### We know ourselves better than anyone can
* We each have circumstances and experiences the other can't know about (stress, values, intentions)

##### We Have Different Interpretations
###### We are influenced by our pasts
* Every strong view you have has a lot to do with your previous experiences
* **Example:** Celebratory Dinner
  * Person is complaining about how things are expensive, but it's free
  * They grew up during the depression and held on to that experience

###### We apply different rules
* Our past causes us to develope "rules" we live by, following them without even knowing it.
* When our rules collid, there are problems.
* **Example:** Business Trip - Meet in Lobby @ 7:00
  * One person shows up at 7:10, which pisses off the other person who then isn't able to focus
  * Other person notices and gets pissed off
  * One person thinks punctuality is critical - other think it's unprofessional to let something small affect ability to work

##### Our Conclusions are Self-Serving
* We look for information that supports our conclusion, and convince ourselves it was right
* "I sometimes failed to persuade the court I was right, but I never failed to persuade myself!"

#### Move From Certainty to Curiosity
* "I wonder what information they have that I don't"

#### Embrace Both Stories: Adopt the "And Stance"
* We usually either accept or reject the other person's stance since we think it means we have to abandon our own
* Instead, we should embrace both stories/stances
* Use "and" instead of "but" and string together both of your perceptions as correct
  * I don't want to be a jerk and I want to be honest and I know this is hurtful and I am I unhappy about this too


### Chapter 3: Don't Assume They Meant It: _Separate Intent From Impact_
* Intentions influence our judgement of others - Doing it on purpose is different than doing by accident

#### First Mistake: Assumptions About Intentions Are Usually Wrong
* We care deeply about the intentions of others but don't actually know what they are
* Intentions are complicated

##### We Assume Intentions Based on Their Impact on Us
* If we are hurt, we assume they intended to hurt us
* Someone shows up late, we assume they're a jerk that doesn't care

##### We Treat Ourselves Much More Forgiving
* Husband forgets to pick up dry cleaning - he's irresponsbile
* I forget to book airline tickets - I'm overworked and stressed
* We're often unaware of the impact our actions have on others

##### We Assume Bad Intentions Mean Bad Character
* We settle into judgements on their character based off assumption of their intentions
* We then look at things they do from this perspective and it becomes easier to not care about them and not challenge self-view

##### Accusing of Bad Intentions Makes People Defensive
* Our assumptions about their intentions affects our behavior, which causes other to make assumptions about our behavior
* We might think we're sharing our feelings, but we're making others defensive:
  * Why do you ignore me like this? 
  * What have I done to make you feel it's ok to step all over me?

##### Attributions Can Be Self-Fulfilling
* When we think there are bad intentions towards us, it affects our behavior
* This affects how others treat us
* Eventually, this can CAUSE people to have the intentions we assumed they had from the beginning

#### Second Mistake: Good Intentions Don't Justify Bad Impact
* You said I meant to hurt you. I have no clarified that I didn't. So you should now feel fine. If you don't, that's your problem.

##### We Don't Hear What They're Really Trying to Say
* Someone says "Why were you trying to hurt me?" they're saying 2 things
  1. I know what you intended
  2. I got hurt
* We react to the first because we feel the need to defend ourselves, and don't pay attention to the second
* When we say "You intended to hurt me" what we mean is "You don't care about me enough"
* **Example:**
  * Father misses his son's basketball game for work
  * Father doesn't intend to hurt his son, but he did
  * His desire to not hurt is son is not as strong as his desire/need to work
  * From the son's perspective, there's no difference between "He wanted to hurt me" and "He didn't want to hurt me, but he didn't make it a priority"

##### We Ignore Complexity of Human Motivations
* People are complicated, intentions are more complicated
* We often don't even fully understand our own intentions
* When people think hard about their intentions, it send a strong positive message to the other about the importance of the relationship
* If someone feels hurt, clarifying intent doesn't make them feel unhurt, it has to recognized and dealth with to be resolved

#### Avoiding First Mistake: _Separate Intent From Impact_
* Ask yourself 3 questions
  1. **Actions** What did they actually say or do?
  2. **Impact** How did this affect me?
  3. **Assumptions** What am I assuming they intended?

##### Hold Your View As Hypothesis
* You don't have enough information to know what they intended, recognize that you're guessing and need more context

##### Share Impact On You; Ask About Their Intentions
* Say what they did, it's impact on you, and your assumption of their intent
* Important to label assumption as a guess, you're checking with them not telling them
* Don't disregard hypothesis, that's not genuine. Just explain what you're feeling and thinking about their intent

##### Some Defensiveness is Inevitable
* The more you relive the person of the need to defend themselves, the more they can actually listen to what you're saying

#### Avoiding Second Mistake: _Listen For Feelings, Reflect on Your Itentions_
* When someone is accusing you of bad intentions, it's really 2 things:
  * An assumption about intentions
  * A feeling resulting from the negative impact
* Start with the feeling, go back to the assumption (but don't ignore either, it's not fair to you)

##### Be Open To Reflect on Your Own Intentions
* Wow, it sounds like what I said really hurt.
* Well, I was thinking about your diet and that I could help you stick to it, but I see how saying it in front of others could be embarassing, I wonder why I didn't see that?



### Chapter 4: Abandon Blame: _Map the Contribution System_
* You are doing a presentation but the assistant packed the wrong slides
  * You can blame explicitly "I don't know how you could have done this"
  * You can blame implicity "Let's do better next time"
* Focusing on blame is bad because it hinders our ability to learn what's really causing the problem, and thus we can't do anything meaningful to correct it
* "Don't Blame Others" is not right either, there's an aspect of blame that's important, **contribution**

#### Distinguishing Blame From Contribution
* Blame is about _judging_, Contribution is about _understanding_

##### Blame is About Judging and Looks Backwards
* "Who is to blame" is really asking 3 questions
  * Did this person cause the problem?
  * If so, how should their actions be judged against some standard of conduct?
  * If the judgement is negative, how should they be punished?
* By saying "This is your fault", you're giving condeming answers to all 3 questions.
  * We're saying not only did you cause this, but you did something bad and should be punished
* This clearly leads to defensiveness

##### Contribution is About Understanding and Looks Forward
* Related but different set of questions
  * How did we each contribute to this situation (What did we each do or not do to get into this mess?)
  * Having identified the contribution system, how can we change it?

#### Contribution is Joint and Interactive
* By rule, when bad things happen in a relationship, everyone has contributed in some important way

##### Blame is the Root of Legal System and Laws
* There is cost when clear assignment of blame is at stake
* People are less forthcoming about things, and the real causation is likely never found or understood

##### Blame Prevents Problem Solving
* Wasting time on who is to blame takes time away from fixing the result or preventing it going forward
  * Dog runs away, we're arguing over who's fault it is instead of finding the dog

##### Blame Can Leave a Bad System Uncovered
* A VP makes a bad decision, gets fired
* Other people who saw it coming didn't speak up, removing the VP didn't fix the problem

##### Contribution is Easier to Raise & Encourages Change
* When people feel blamed, they question the blame instead of raising real concerns that will fix the problem moving forward
* It's just better

#### Misconceptions About Contribution
* I should only focus on my contributions
* Putting aside blame means putting aside my feelings
  * Sharing feelings is the critical part of this
* Exploring contribution means "blaming the victim"

#### 4 Hard To Spot Contributions
1. Avoiding Until Now
  * Not communicating a problem which leads to a bigger one
2. Being Unapproachable
  * Being intimidating to bring feedback to
3. Intersections
  * People have two deeply rooted ways of doing things that come off as negative to the other
  * Married couple:
    * Husband speaks up to tackle problems due to issues with alcohol and his mom
    * Wife has learned to not overreact to everything due to handicapped brother
    * Wife feels smothered, husband feels like she doesn't deal with emotions
4. Problematic Role Assumptions
  * Leaders set strategy - subordiantes implement it

#### Tools For Spotting Contribution
1. Role reversal
  * Pretend to be the other person (using I, me, myself)
2. Observer's insights
  * Pretend to view the issue from a neutral 3rd party, what does it look like?


# 3. The Feelings Conversation

### Chapter 5: Have Your Feelings _(Or They Will Have You)_

#### Feelings Matter
* Managing feelings is hard, and not addressing them derails a lot of difficult conversations
* **Example:** Dad & Daughter planning wedding
* Keeping feelings out damages relationship

##### We Look At the Problem With Feelings Removed
* Solving problems seems easier than talking about emotions, so we exclude them
* Sharing feelings is risky
  * We can hurt others or ruin relationships
  * We put ourselves in a position to get hurt

##### Unshared Feelings Leak Into the Conversation
* When not dealt with, feelings have a way of working their way into the conversation anyhow, usually in a bad way
* Unspoken feelings color conversations
  * Alter tone of voice
  * Come out in body language or facial expressions
  * Sarcasm, agression, impatience, unpredictability, defensiveness
* "When clocked, your emotional pipes will leak"
* This can lead to being completely disengaged, refusing to work with or talk to people
* We don't overreact because we overshare, it's because we don't express them enough (like shaking up a can of soda)

##### Not Sharing Feelings Makes it Hard to Listen
* When people have a hard time listening, it's often because they have a hard time expressing themself
  * Buried emotions prevent us from listening

#### Learn Where Feelings Hide
* Feelings are complicated, and we wrongly assume we know how we feel
* For uncomfortable feelings, we often recognize them as feelings we can better cope with

##### Emotional Footprint
* How did your family deal with emotions?  Which feelings were allowed and which were off-limits?
* Your feelings also differ depending on who you're with (mother vs friend vs stranger)

##### Things To Do
* Accept that feelings are normal. Some families don't allow for any feelings, which results in shame when you have them
* Good people can have bad feelings.  We expect ourselves to have specific reactions, and when we don't it affects our self-image.
* Your feeling are as important as theirs.  We often think about other's feelings before ours, which results in us not sharing or communicating well.
  * You might not raise something so you don't jeopardize the relationship, but by not raising it your resentment will erode the relationship
* Don't let hidden feelings block other emotions
* Don't make attributions about the other person
  * "You are self-absorbed" is not a feeling, it's an attribution that is hiding the feeling you're having
  * Judgements feel like feelings (fueled by a real emotion), but they aren't communicated as feelings and are confusing and disruptive
  * "You are thoughtless and self-absorbed" vs "I feel hurt, confused, and embarassed"
* Use the urge to blame as a cue that there's a hidden emotion
  * Discussing contribution can feel empty because you still want to blame, this usually means you haven't shared an important feeling
* Negotiate your feelings before sharing
  * Think about the "What Happened Conversation"
  * What is the other person's story?
  * What assumptions am I making?
  * What were contributions from both side?

#### Describe Feeling Carefully (Don't Vent)
1. Frame Feelings Back into the Problem
  * Feelings are important, so get them out and decide what to do with them later
2. Express Full Spectrum of Feelings
  * Things are complicated, so dig deep and find the hidden feelings, not the easiest one to share
  * "It's hard for me to talk with you about this..." vs "Stop bugging me"
3. Share - Don't Evaluate
  * Share pure feelings without judgement, attributions, or blame
  * Save problem solving for later
  * Don't monopolize

#### Acknowledgement is Important
* Make sure the other person feels like their feelings are acknowledged
* It's tempting to skip feelings and solve problems, but that prevents feeling acknowledged


# 4. The Identity Conversation

### Chapter 6: Ground Your Identity: _Ask Yourself What’s at Stake_


#### Difficult Conversations Threaten Our Diversities

##### Three Core Identities

##### An Identity Quake Can Knock Us Off Balance

##### There's No Quick Fix


#### Vulnerable Identities: The All-Or-Nothing Syndrome

##### Denial

##### Exaggeration

##### Step One: Become Aware of Your Identity Issues

##### Step Two: Complexify Your Identity (Adopt the "And" Stance)


#### Three Things To Accept About Yourself

##### 1. You Will Make Mistakes

##### 2. Your Intentions Are Complex

##### 3. You Have Contributed to the Problem


#### During the Conversation: Learn to Regain Your Balance

##### Let Go of Trying to Control Their Reaction

##### Prepare for Their Response

##### Imagine That It's Three Months Or Ten Years From Now

##### Take a Break


#### Their Identity Is Also Implicated

##### Raising Identity Issues Explicitly

##### Find the Courage to Ask for Help



# 5. Creating a Learning Conversation

### Chapter 7: What's Your Purpose? _When to Raise It and When to Let Go_



### Chapter 8: Getting Started: _Begin from the Third Story_
* Beginning of a difficult conversation
  * Often the most stressful but also most important
  * Opportunity to set tone and direction of entire conversation

#### Why Our Typical Openings Don't Help

##### We Begin Inside Our Own Story
* We start talking about the story from our viewpoint, which will retrigger the reaction the other person had to begin with
* Leaves out their viewpoint and issues from the get-go and can easily trigger defensiveness

##### We Trigger Their Identity Conversation from the Start
* Our story passes judgement since in our version of the story the other person is the issue

#### Step One: Begin from the Third Story
* Third Story being how an outsider with no stake in interest in the situation would view the events

##### Think Like a Mediator
* Mediator works to identify the third story and isn't impact by the consensus
* Mediator works to come up with a description of the story that both sides agree to, not the story one side agrees to as that's what each person has already done which lead to the conflict

##### Not Right or Wrong, Not Better or Worse - Just Different
* The key to the third story is understanding and describing the gap between the stories between people
* Example: Jason upset with Jill leaving dishes in the sink, Jill upset with Jason's habits and cleaning while she's still eating
  * Third Story: There is a disagreeemnt between Jason and Jill about how dishes are handled
* Acknowledge there's a difference, which both can agree to since it includes both of them

##### If They Start the Conversation, You Can Still Step to the Third Story
* If someone else initiates the conversation, instead of defending yourself or telling your story, trying to jump into the Third Story is possible and can allow the conversation to be productive
  * Jill comes to Jason complaining, Jason might say "Sounds like you have trouble, I'm also unhappy, seems like it would be a good thing to talk about?"

#### Step Two: Extend an Invitation
* After describing the problem, proposing mutual understanding and problem solving can help drive the conversation to a positive outcome

##### Describe Your Purposes
* Let them know you want to discuss and understand their perspective, they need to know what they're agreeing to

##### Invite, Don't Impose
* Let them know that even describing the problem is open for debate if they're resistant or hesitant

##### Make Them Your Partner in Figuring It Out
* Avoid paiting them as the problem that will be solved, and be genuine and open to discussing more
* Ensure they don't feel like you've already decided it's their fault and that you're open to wherever the discussion goes...involving them is necessary and you're not doing it just to go through the motions
