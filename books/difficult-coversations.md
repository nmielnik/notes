# The Problem

### Each Difficult Coversation is really 3 conversations

#### The "What Happened" Coversation - What's the story here?
* Who said what, who did what, who's right, who meant what, who's to blame

##### The Truth Assumption
* I am right, you are wrong.
  * The quest to determine who is right is a dead end.
* Difficult conversations aren't about getting facts right, they're about conflicting perceptions, interpretations, and values.
  * Moving away from the truth assumption allows us to understand perception, interpretations, and values from both sides

##### The Intention Invention
* The conversation about intentions - both yours and mine
* What I think your intentions are impact how I think about you and how the conversation goes
* We assume we know the other person's intentions when we don't.  We assume their intentions are bad more than we don't.
* Intentions are complex and leaping to unfound assumptions can be a disaster

##### The Blame Frame
* Nobody wants to be blamed, so we just defend ourselves instead of having a productive conversation
* Example of kids arguing in back seat "She hit me" - "I hit her cuz she called me a baby"

#### The Feelings Conversation - What should we do with our emotions?
* Are my feelings valid, appropriate? Should I share them?
  * Bring up our feeings can be scary and make us vulnerable. What if they dismiss our feelings?
* What do I do about the other person's feelings
  * If we share ours, and they share theirs, are we up to listening to this?
* We tend to just skip this conversation

> Engaging in a difficult conversation without talking about feelings is like staging an opera without the music. Youâ€™ll get the plot but miss the point.

#### The Identity Conversation - What does this say about me?
* View of our self-image
* Am I competent or imcompetent? Am I a good person or bad?
* Example: We're asking for a raise
  * Seems like it's money, but it's about us
  * What if they say no?  What if they give us good reason why we don't deserve it?
* Example: Talking to neighbors about their dog
  * We view ourselves as good people
  * This could make us appear as mean or a troublemaker
* As you feel the implications on your self-image you may lose your balance
  * This can cause you to lose confidence or concentratio
  * In it's worst case we may feel paralyzed or overcome by panic

### Move Towards Learning Conversation
* Despite what we pretend, our intention is usually to deliver a message (prove a point, give them a piece of our mind)
* Instead of persuading to get your way:
  1. Learn other's perspective
  2. Explain your point of view
  3. Share and understand feelings
  4. Work together to find a way to manage the problem going forward
* There is always some piece of information the other person has that you don't
