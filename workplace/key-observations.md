# Key Observations

* At times, people will avoid asking questions
  * Folks fear that if they ask "dumb" questions or ask too many questions, they will appear incompetent or lazy.
  * Folks also feel like they can figure things out on their own at times and can spend a lot of time digging into something without stopping to consider whether asking a few questions could help them avoid all of this extra work.

* Generally speaking, people enjoy being asked questions, which is often the opposite of what others expect.
  * Being approached to answer a question is a sign of respect, since someone has sought you out for information because they feel you know something they don't and are a reliable person to ask.
  * Being asked a question also brings another person into a discussion, which can feel good since you now have an opportunity to share your knowledge and opinions to others in a setting where you can be confident your knowledge and opinions are welcome (as opposed to try to jump into another conversation or share unsolicited information which may or may not actually be desired)

* People appreciate trust and investment
  * Actually being invested in someone else's career impacts the amount that they care and think about their careers.  Remembering important things that have happened or will be happening and asking about them or having more consistent conversations across 1:1's helps convey these things.
    * Taking notes in 1:1's makes this a lot easier
  * Trusting people with information that not other people have also shows that you trust them and are allowing the person to know things that could impact your own career.  That shows investment because to trust is to be invested in someone.
    * It doesn't have to be confidential organization information, it can be facts about yourself or your own experiences/life, or inteactions you have with other people that you trust someone not to share.  There are many ways to demonstrate trust with someone you're mentoring.
