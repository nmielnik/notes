# MEDIUM-EDITOR <!-- .element: class="presentationHeading" -->
### An open source story



# Once Upon A Time
* The Vistaprint Digital Team was building a website builder from scratch
* Needed a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) text editor at the core
* (maybe notes about project, team)


## WYSIWYG Text Editing Is Hard
* (Talk about the problem space, which drove wanting open source)



# Open-Source
* Wanted to tap into open source community
* People knew better than us, and wanted help with maintaining it long term



# The Search
* Alternatives explored: quill, scribe, wysihtml, ArteJS (VP open source), medium-editor



# ArteJS
  * https://github.com/vistaprint/ArteJS
  * This is a different way of going about open-source (build it and hope people come)
  * Very little contribution or community



# medium-editor
* medium inspired text editor
* Found a vibrant, active community with 4000+ stars and 100+ contributors
* Began opening pull-requests for fixes/features we needed
  * [First PR](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor/pull/342)
* Really my first dive into open-source contributing



# A Surprising Email
* Show email I received from Davi asking if I want to become a collaborator
* Became collaborator on 01/27/15



# High Energy Rise
* Modularized the codebase
* Created a cross-browser testing framework for each PR (SauceLabs)
* Code coverage test and feedback on PRs (coveralls)
* (Things are going great...but Davi, the founder, leaves)


## Milestones
* 3/5/15 - 90% Code Coverage
* Formation of YABWE group
* Include on product hunt
* Most starred editor on github (~8k i think)
* v5.0.0 w/ documentation + plug-in framework
  * link-insert + editing feature

# Foreshadowing
* I've rewritten a ton of the code and documentation, but now others don't know how to do much
* I'm spending most of my out-of-work time on medium-editor


## Other Not-So-Glamourous-Parts
* Code Quality vs Low Barrier To Entry
* Encouraging documentation and best practices
* Responding to unhelpful issues / feature requests



# Cracks Are Showing
* My sitebuilder team begins working on other things
  * Noah hasn't contributed in 1+ years
* Now I'm supporting it on my own
* Start trying to recruit others to YABWE to help
  * Engineering Lightning Talk (03-22-16)
  * Pushing on yabwe folks



# Things Get Worse
* 0% of time at work is on medium-editor
* medium-editor is at v5.23.0, Tower is using v5.5.0! (Jira Ticket)
* ProseMirror + DraftJS + Carbon emerge, as state-backed editors
* TODO's on my home dry erase board are so old they won't erase



# Decision Time
* Do I pause (or end) my VP career to work on this open-source editor with 10k+ stars and lots of attention?
* (Spoiler Alert) I abandoned the editor


# Where Are They Now?
* Me & my career
* Noah
* Davi
* j0ker
* yabwe



# medium-editor Today
* Sitebuilder still isn't using the latest version
* medium-editor is up over 1200 stars
* endless un-triaged issues, very painful for me
* I've popped in once or twice and tried to get things moving and then lost momentum quickly



# Lessons
* Things to consider when working on open-source
* Importance of vibrant community and recruiting
  * Davi recruited me quickly, I waited too long to do the same
* The downside of the glamour <-- what are we really trying to say here?  I think you want the last slide and bullet to capture the whole journey as something that was a great accelerator for the business, a rewarding personal journey, but something that left you with lingering feelings of guilt / regret
