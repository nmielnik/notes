* Each time someone says "Nah, I'm not smart enough" or each time someone thinks "No, I'm not good enough" the brightness of our world's collective future gets a bit dimmer.

* Wisdom and experience are dangerous, they can lead to us making assumptions and inevitably making bad decisions that will lead to "someone" else's detriment. To make it worse, that "someone" is usually completely unaware that this assumption is being made and thus cannot do anything to impact it now or prevent it from happening repeatedly in the future.

* One thing that separates us as "human" from other species is pattern matching and seeing trends in things we observe.  This allows us to improve our survival but also do things to each other that other animals would never do.

* It's safe to assume that people would not knowingly cause significant harm to the people they care about.  However, we are constantly doing this sort of thing uknowingly as we don't fully understand the ramifications of our actions until well after the fact.  It's also true that if we attempted to understand the vast impact of each of our decisions before making them, we'd struggle immensely with every decision and be crippled to a degree.
