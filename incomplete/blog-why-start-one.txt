# Why start a blog?

1. I need to organize my thoughts
* I have such an immense amount of interesting thoughts that I so often just let drift away unfulfilled

2. I need purpose
* Routine and a sense of building something are important to me

3. I feel obligated to make use of my talents and good fortune
* I have intelligence, but a blend of a lot of other things which give me unique perspective
* I'm fortunate and have strong ethical / moral guidelines on my own

4. I know I can help a lot of people and impact the world for the better
* I've helped a lot of people by sharing my thoughts and opinions, I want to spread this ability and help others to do the same

5. I enjoy thinking more than just about anything
* There's not much I enjoy more than a philosophical analysis of just about anything

6. I'm willing to take some criticism if it's for a better purpose
* I've been unafraid to challenge things that need to be challenged, even if it can be not-so-great for myself in the short term
* I'm ok with not being politically correct as long as it doesn't actually hurt someone else or make them feel lesser or insignificant

7. I see simplicity in our problems and unnecessary complexity everywhere, and there has to be something that can be done about it
* I can't be the only one who sees these things, but maybe I'm one of the few who has real hope that it can be changed.  I refuse to do what I see as the wrong thing just because people want me to.  However, I'm always open to the idea that I'm wrong about something, and being shown that can help me pivot my opinion very quickly

8. I'm awkward and off-putting if you don't get to know me
* I struggle with new people because I need trust and safety to really openly communicate, and it's hard to get that with new people

9. I don't know what to do
* By sharing my thoughts, passions, and talents, maybe the path forward will reveal itself.  Keeping it in my head definitey doesn't improve the chances for me figuring it out

10. I view leadership as a responsibility, not a privilege
* I think this is a core requirement of leadership that is often unmet

10. I'm happy to admit I'm wrong as long as I can still be credible or part of the conversation
* As long as it doesn't mean my opinion no longer matters, I am happy to admit I'm wrong about anything...knowing you're wrong means you're in the best position to grow and improve, as long as someone doesn't take away your ability to improve simply because you were wrong
* Being wrong is a core part of growing as people, and I'd be willing to say we can never really improve without the ability to fail without consequence.  Thus, environment where it's not safe to fail are incredibly handicapped when it comes to actually solving problems
