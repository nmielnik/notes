# Key Observations

## Not Asking Questions
_People tend to avoid asking questions when they're unsure_

* At times, people will avoid asking questions
  * Folks fear that if they ask "dumb" questions or ask too many questions, they will appear incompetent or lazy.
  * Folks also feel like they can figure things out on their own at times and can spend a lot of time digging into something without stopping to consider whether asking a few questions could help them avoid all of this extra work.
* Generally speaking, people enjoy being asked questions, which is often the opposite of what others expect.
  * Being approached to answer a question is a sign of respect, since someone has sought you out for information because they feel you know something they don't and are a reliable person to ask.
  * Being asked a question also brings another person into a discussion, which can feel good since you now have an opportunity to share your knowledge and opinions to others in a setting where you can be confident your knowledge and opinions are welcome (as opposed to try to jump into another conversation or share unsolicited information which may or may not actually be desired)

## Investment & Trust
_People appreciate trust and investment_

* Actually being invested in someone else's career impacts the amount that they care and think about their careers.  Remembering important things that have happened or will be happening and asking about them or having more consistent conversations across 1:1's helps convey these things.
  * Taking notes in 1:1's makes this a lot easier
* Trusting people with information that not other people have also shows that you trust them and are allowing the person to know things that could impact your own career.  That shows investment because to trust is to be invested in someone.
  * It doesn't have to be confidential organization information, it can be facts about yourself or your own experiences/life, or inteactions you have with other people that you trust someone not to share.  There are many ways to demonstrate trust with someone you're mentoring.
  * Sharing privileged information, either about the organization or yourself, motivates people to act differently or to try to do something valuable with that information

## What Is Expected of a Mentor?
_There isn't a well defined set of responsibilities for mentorship and this leads to confusion and inconsistent expectations_

* Passive vs Active Mentorshp
  * **Passive Mentorship**
    * Meeting regularly with someone 1:1 (usually once every 2 weeks)
    * When a mentee asks questions or asks for help, this becomes the top priority until the question is answered or the issue is resolved
    * Make sure the mentee knows that the mentor is always available and makes time when asked
    * Can help inform others how the mentee is doing and weigh in on performance discussions or organizational decisions
    * Acts as the point person to receive feedback to be delivered to the mentee.  Someone others can raise issues with when conflicts occur with the mentee
    * Ultimately, mentee drives what the mentor does and mentor generally reacts more than is proactive
  * **Active Mentorship**
    * Mentor meets often with the mentee and has some expectations about what should happen at each 1:1
    * Mentor actively brings up topics and prods mentor to talk about challenges from the past week or 2 to be talked about
    * Mentor views their success as continued growth from mentee where remaining stationary is viewed as not sufficient
    * Mentor helps for a long term plan with long term aspirations with mentee, as well as actionable steps to get to that plan (this will often include setting SMART goals on a regular basis)
    * Ultimately, mentor drives the discussion and constantly pushes the mentee to grow.  This often means being an advocate for the mentee or seeking out opportunities for the mentee beyond the weekly 1:1's
* There is a significant difference between passive and active mentorship but we call them the same thing.
  * Should every employee have at least one active mentor?  My feeling is yes.
  * Should we call these 2 different things and be explicit about when someone is doing one thing or the other?
  * Who should be assessing performance?  Who should be deciding if the performance is not good enough and when parting ways is better than continuing to try to increase performance unsuccessfully?
* Team Lead, Scrum Master, Product Owner
  * Within scrum teams, there are different roles that generally emerge
  * When it comes to day-to-day tasks and the level of contribution that a person has on a team, these folks have the best visibility (along with other team members)
  * The best opportunity for technical guidance and teaching comes from coworkers on the same team. The best way to learn fully absorb and understand new techincal concepts is to practice and apply those concepts directly in your day-to-day work.

### Workplace Discussion
_The expectations of a mentor was chosen as a topic during a mentorship meeting at work, these were the items called out_

1. Know the expectations of your mentee and be able to relay them
2. Be willing to experiment with different strategies/approaches of coaching
3. Be invested in the success of your mentee
4. Facilitate collection of actionable feedback
5. Understand motivation of mentee and act on connecting them with that
6. Helping find opportunities for the mentee
7. Be able to know if you're being effective or identifying if you're not and someone else might be able to

* NOTE: It seems like the first point (1) around defining the expectations is the most critical of these.  That one should be accomplished first and well understood before starting to tackle any of 2-7.


## Job Levels
_Job levels hurt more than help and cause us to not put enough effort into important decisions and put too much thought into unimportant ones_

* Job levels are not something the directly benefits a business.
  * At it's core, a business makes money by delivering value to customers.  It needs people to be able to execute on that, and you need those people to be motivated to help the company get there, so ultimately a company just needs employees who are motivated to help the company.
  * There are many things that motivate people, including compensation, recognition, challenge, being part of something bigger than themselves, autonomy, and mastery. Job levels become a motivator for employees via these avenues, but they are not just motivating on their own (it's not the title, it's the recognition and benefits that come along with the title that's motivating)
* Job levels aren't how we operate in other groups
  * In team sports, families, groups of friends, neighborhoods, or other group activities, something equivalent to job levels hasn't emerged as a necessary way to do things.  It can be normal for someone to step into a leadership role, but it might just be for certain circumstances or situations and could be someone else for others.  Roles are often defined as well based on what people are good at or like to do, but a clear level and hierarchy doesn't automatically arise out of just that.
  * Other than the military, I can't think of other places where something equivalent to job levels is a necessary part of the system.
* Job levels can restrict or limit the unique ways people can contribute to an organization
  * (something something...)
* Job levels can become overloaded and begin to be used in ways they weren't intended
  * (something something...)
* Job levels can encourage folks to focus soley on themselves rather than others or the success of the company
  * (something something...)
