### 10 Expectations of Leaders
_inspired by [10 simple things that teams expect from their leader](https://www.inc.com/gordon-tredgold/10-simple-things-that-teams-expect-from-their-leader.html)_

##### Clarity, Transparency, & Honesty
People always strive to understand what they're responsible for and what ways they can contribute and provide value. People also despise feeling mislead, lied to, or tricked.  This is at the core of how someone representing a team communicates to their team what they've heard or are thinking.

Sharing information to your team in a truthful, honest, and authentic tone is valuable.  Even if the information could seem disruptive, unfair, or just negative in general, being upfront with it and not trying to sugar coat the truth will ultimately be valued by the team.

Information doesn't have to be perfectly formed either, being vulnerable with your thoughts and asking the team to help you figure determined how to translate your thoughts or observations into action items will be valued by your team plus builds respect and trust.

We've all experienced a leader giving a message that sounds overly sugar-coated, or maybe even flat-out false.  Whether you think there's a hidden message that leadership is afraid to say out loud, or you're constantly waiting for the "but" after a positive-sounding lead-up, we can all empathize with that feeling.  That's why the times when leaders are especially straightforward or even blunt can be powerful events and have a large impact on your feelings towards leadership.  Of course, coming out and spewing insults and a bunch of criticism that may not be true is a terrible idea, but being authentic and honest has never lead me astray.

Mistakes and unexpectated changes happen, sugar-coating or trying to make it sound positive and unimportant won't change the truth and can risk your credibility.  Keeping things to yourself and assuming folks on your team will react in a negative way to information will almost always lead to bad decisions by yourself, so don't do it.  Let your team react to information and solve the problems as a team, they're adults too, treat them like it.

Good Example
> I was just in a meeting where it feels like folks have changed their minds or are saying something completely different than before.  I have faith that they have a consistent plan and that we're doing the right things so I'm wondering if I misunderstood.  This is what I think I heard, you all tell me what you think this means: "..."

Not-so-good Examples
> The status update meeting was fine, they're really happy with how we've been doing so keep up the great work.

##### Opportunity & Involvement

##### Keep Commitments & Consistency

##### Trust & Respect

##### Timely, Constructive Feedback
(both praise and differential)

##### Stand Up For the Team

## Defining Expectations
_Negative outcomes or undesirable behavior are very likely tied to unclear expectations_

### Many Problems Arise From Unclear Expectations
* Situations arising around someone not meeting expectations are partciularly hard to navigate and we often find ourselves trying all kinds of indirect ways to solve the problem including just ignoring it.  Examples:
  1. A team member has been taking too long with a specific work item
  2. The leader of a team did not engage with other teams and ended up duplicating work or causing something that blocked someone else
  3. A mentor is not pushing their mentee or seeking out the right kind of opportunities for their mentee
  4. Someone in a leadership position did not seek out the input and feedback of their team before making decisions for them
* If you ask yourself "Am I certain that the other person has a clear understanding of the expectations put on them?".  In most cases, the answer is probably "No", and the solution could be as simple as working together to define the expectations in a clear way.
* For each of the previous examples, it isn't hard to see how unclear expectations would very quickly lead to problems:
  1. The team member has never been told how long work should take.  They've seen people take a week or more on difficult problems, and they view their problems as difficult. They might think that bringing in other teammates who have their own tasks would be a waste of the team's time so they don't ask for help.  They didn't know they were **expected** to get help and complete work quickly above all else
  2. The team lead may think their number 1 goal is to unblock their team at all times and avoid slowing themselves down with unnecessary dependencies or complications.  They might not have any idea whether another team is working on the same thing and/or they may focus on unblocking their team members by showing them how to workaround things without any idea a solution already exists or they could be causing a conflict. They didn't know they were **expected** to interact closely with other teams and keep up to date with all the other teams are doing.
  3. The mentor may be a newer employee and be leaning heavily on their previous experience in other locations.  They might see mentorship as the responsibility of ensuring the mentee has completed all their work quickly and is meeting the expectations of their team.  They might just ask for current status reports and if any issues are brought up, look for a way to unblock them.  The mentor didn't know that they were **expected** to be seeking out opportunities or **expected** to push their mentees out of their comfort zone as a way to grow the mentee's career.
  4. The leader could view their role as a shield who protects the team from questions and information that might distract or have the team feeling worried or responsible for things that they don't need to worry about.  The leader could object and push back to someone wanting to get a bunch of estimates on how long it would take for a certain work item to be complete.  The leader didn't know their team **expected** them to communicate what kind of possibile things they could be working on next and allow the team to get to consensus on whether any potential work is valuable for the team's goals.

### There Are Expectations In Every Role / Relationships
* If you think about all the different interactions you have on a daily basis with friends, family, and co-workers, how many of them do you think really understand what you expect of them?  Do you have a clear understanding of what they expect of you?  Do you know exactly what your boss expects of you on a daily basis?  These things are extremely easy to make assumptions about, but they are _our_ assumptions based on our own experiences and perceptions, which is almost certainly not the same as what someone else expects.
* The main takeaway is, it can be worthwhile to have a conversations about expectations on both sides of all your roles and relationships.  At the very least, when any issue arises, the first thought should "does everyone here have a clear understanding of the expectations being placed on them?"

### Defining Expectations
* Before there's conflict, it never hurts to take a little time to ask the people you interact with what their expectations are of you.  It's also worth asking them what they think your expectations are of them.  It's extremely likely that you'll both learn something new and valuable through this.  Doing this before there's an issue can give the conversation the best chances of staying in a positive context.
* People can start trying to figure out what you're really getting at, or assume you're inferring a problem when you start to talk about expectations, so trying to do this before issues arise can help a lot.
* Whether you're in a leadership role, working with a peer, or helping out a friend, just asking the other folks what their expectations are of you, and what they think your expectations are of them will be a fruitful and telling conversation.

## Motivation
* The things that motivate people might be so obvious to them that it's hard for them to even recognize it.  If you ask someone what they need to feel happy, they probably won't suggest "breathing" as the the first thing.
* If you say out loud the thing that you think someone cares a lot about and motivates them, and their response is something along the lines of "Yeah but that's not helpful, that's just something everyone cares about" or "well so what, everyone cares about that, what's your point?"...then you probably found a real motivator.  At first, talking about a core motivation can be odd because it's hard for people to imagine it not being something that motivates others, but in reality it's often the case that it's not.
