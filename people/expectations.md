# Expectations

## Defining Expectations
_Negative outcomes or undesirable behavior are very likely tied to unclear expectations_

### Many Problems Arise From Unclear Expectations
* Situations arising around someone not meeting expectations are partciularly hard to navigate and we often find ourselves trying all kinds of indirect ways to solve the problem including just ignoring it.  Examples:
  1. A team member has been taking too long with a specific work item
  2. The leader of a team did not engage with other teams and ended up duplicating work or causing something that blocked someone else
  3. A mentor is not pushing their mentee or seeking out the right kind of opportunities for their mentee
  4. Someone in a leadership position did not seek out the input and feedback of their team before making decisions for them
* If you ask yourself "Am I certain that the other person has a clear understanding of the expectations put on them?".  In most cases, the answer is probably "No", and the solution could be as simple as working together to define the expectations in a clear way.
* For each of the previous examples, it isn't hard to see how unclear expectations would very quickly lead to problems:
  1. The team member has never been told how long work should take.  They've seen people take a week or more on difficult problems, and they view their problems as difficult. They might think that bringing in other teammates who have their own tasks would be a waste of the team's time so they don't ask for help.  They didn't know they were **expected** to get help and complete work quickly above all else
  2. The team lead may think their number 1 goal is to unblock their team at all times and avoid slowing themselves down with unnecessary dependencies or complications.  They might not have any idea whether another team is working on the same thing and/or they may focus on unblocking their team members by showing them how to workaround things without any idea a solution already exists or they could be causing a conflict. They didn't know they were **expected** to interact closely with other teams and keep up to date with all the other teams are doing.
  3. The mentor may be a newer employee and be leaning heavily on their previous experience in other locations.  They might see mentorship as the responsibility of ensuring the mentee has completed all their work quickly and is meeting the expectations of their team.  They might just ask for current status reports and if any issues are brought up, look for a way to unblock them.  The mentor didn't know that they were **expected** to be seeking out opportunities or **expected** to push their mentees out of their comfort zone as a way to grow the mentee's career.
  4. The leader could view their role as a shield who protects the team from questions and information that might distract or have the team feeling worried or responsible for things that they don't need to worry about.  The leader could object and push back to someone wanting to get a bunch of estimates on how long it would take for a certain work item to be complete.  The leader didn't know their team **expected** them to communicate what kind of possibile things they could be working on next and allow the team to get to consensus on whether any potential work is valuable for the team's goals.

### There Are Expectations In Every Role / Relationships
* If you think about all the different interactions you have on a daily basis with friends, family, and co-workers, how many of them do you think really understand what you expect of them?  Do you have a clear understanding of what they expect of you?  Do you know exactly what your boss expects of you on a daily basis?  These things are extremely easy to make assumptions about, but they are _our_ assumptions based on our own experiences and perceptions, which is almost certainly not the same as what someone else expects.
* The main takeaway is, it can be worthwhile to have a conversations about expectations on both sides of all your roles and relationships.  At the very least, when any issue arises, the first thought should "does everyone here have a clear understanding of the expectations being placed on them?"

### Defining Expectations
* Before there's conflict, it never hurts to take a little time to ask the people you interact with what their expectations are of you.  It's also worth asking them what they think your expectations are of them.  It's extremely likely that you'll both learn something new and valuable through this.  Doing this before there's an issue can give the conversation the best chances of staying in a positive context.
* People can start trying to figure out what you're really getting at, or assume you're inferring a problem when you start to talk about expectations, so trying to do this before issues arise can help a lot.
* Whether you're in a leadership role, working with a peer, or helping out a friend, just asking the other folks what their expectations are of you, and what they think your expectations are of them will be a fruitful and telling conversation.

## Motivation
* The things that motivate people might be so obvious to them that it's hard for them to even recognize it.  If you ask someone what they need to feel happy, they probably won't suggest "breathing" as the the first thing.
* If you say out loud the thing that you think someone cares a lot about and motivates them, and their response is something along the lines of "Yeah but that's not helpful, that's just something everyone cares about" or "well so what, everyone cares about that, what's your point?"...then you probably found a real motivator.  At first, talking about a core motivation can be odd because it's hard for people to imagine it not being something that motivates others, but in reality it's often the case that it's not.
