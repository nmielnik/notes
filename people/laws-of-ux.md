# Laws of UX
_(my quick notes from an awesome collection on https://lawsofux.com/ by [John Yablonski](https://jonyablonski.com/))

## Fitt's Law

> The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.


## Hick's Law

> The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.


## Jakob's Law

> Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.


## Law of PrÃ¤gnanz

> People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.


## Law of Proximity

> Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.


## Law of Similarity

> The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.


## Law of Uniform Connectedness

> Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.


## Miller's Law

> The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.


## Occam's Razor

> Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.


## Pareto Principle

> The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.


## Parkinson's Law

> Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.


## Serial Position Effect

> Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.


## Tesler's Law (aka The Law of Conservation of Complexity)

> For any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.


## Von Restorff Effect (aka The Isolation Effect)

> When multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.


## Zeigarnik Effect

> People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
