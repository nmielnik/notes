# What Are the Possibilities of Blockchain?

## Technological Advancements
Right now we're at the intersection of so many different advances in technology and how we interact that in some ways it feels like this technological revolution has been building for quite a while.

The rise of Kickstarter was a huge demonstration of just what could happen if you expose anyone to the possiblities of investing in ideas they beleive, even if they get little to nothing in return.

We're also seeing the final realization of all those dot-com ideas that rose and fall in such an epic way.  You can order your groceries online, you can order all your pet food online, you can hire contractors to come clean your house or mow your lawn online...all things that the internet was not ready to support at the dot-com craze but have proven to be valuable ideas ultimately.

The following is a list of various categories where all of our technology (not just blockchain) can influence.

### Power/Independence
* Currencies no longer needing governments and militaries to protect and enforce their value
* The possibility of a global currency that is not controlled for the benefit of one specific country (sorry USD)
* Even playing field to build and maintain wealth in secure ways worldwide
* Methods of connecting and interacting with others through the internet in complete anonymity
* Through solar power and elimination of the middleman in blockchain, we now have ways to be fully self-sufficient individuals
* The ability to raise funds and connect with anyone directly mean the ability to impact change and being revolutions

### Currency
* Evolution of currency beyond material metals
* Orders of magnitude improvement of concepts like supply, access, and control
* Iterate and improve massively outdated concepts that were not-changable due to status-quo and who has power

### Software
* New technological possibilities from blockchain
* Incentive contribution to open-source technology (instead of just doing it for fun)
* Moving away from web programming and back into building software on computers (instead of just in the web browser)

### Kickstarters
* Raising money for ideas people believe in, even if little or nothing is received in return ([more than $3B raised](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)!)

### Black Market
* Anonymous interactions and payments
* Massive market evolution of black market (pricing, governance, safety)
* Protection for whistle blowers or victims of government opression

### Workforce
* Hiring contractors for specific items with reputation and reviews
* Decentralized governance of products/businesses/organizations where money goes towards customer-proposed ideas

### Crowd Knowledge / Forecasting
* Knowledge of the crowd for betting on future events (elections, weather, flight cancellations, etc.)
* Forecasting the liklihood of future events based on these prediction markets
* Setting insurance premiums based on liklihood of upcoming events

### Gambling
* Best possible system for odds making
* Eliminating central authority who gets a cut and can operate in shady ways

### Angel Investing
* Early access to new companies for everyone
* Companies don't give up ownership of their company (ICO)
  * Doesn't have to be tied directly to business
* Give the whole world access, instead of just the mega-rich elite

### Collecting
* Ability to create and exchange verifiably unique things
* Rarity and long-term value improvement (Art collectors)

### Charity/Research
* Ability to directly fund charities or research in completely transparent ways
* Ability to get something of material value in return (beyond tax deduction) or actually see the impact you had

### Online Revenue Model Changes
* Can now have visitors mine a currency instead of asking for donations or putting targeted advertisements
* Companies like Basic Attention Token or AdEx turning the advertising model on its head
* Original spirit of the internet where content providers own and profit from their creations (Musicians, Writies, Actors, etc.)

### Gaming/Virtual Life
* Creating completey digital assets and selling them for real money
* An entire economy of real money, which can now seamlessly transfer between virtual and real world with cryptos
* Further legitmization of the multi-billion dollar gaming industry (professional gamers, gambling, virtual world economies, etc)

### AI/Neural Networks
* Evolve understanding of our world and how humans interact
* Ability to leverage massive computing power of blockchains into things like AI or Neural Networks

### Identity & Authenticity
* Ability to own your private data and not allow businesses to keep a copy of it
* Singificant improvements in security to make it hard or impossible to steal your identity
* Methods of proving the authenticity of digital and real-world assets

### Governance
* A truly efficient and effective democracy where everyone has a vote but people can coordinate and vote quickly and easily (digitally)
* True free market (capitalism)
* Ability to having a living wage through staking (socialism)

### Philosophical
* Is this a more natural cycle of redistributing wealth to the poor?
* Will this provide a natural solution to the student loan problems of young people?
* Does this give millenials a generational advantage that other generations have had in different ways?
* Ability to demonstrate the natural "goodness" of humans with pure and free markets & governance

## High-Level Categories
This is a more refined version of the list above, with broad top-level categories and key concepts underneath.  The separation here is important in that world-changing impact can happen in each of these areas in completely independent ways.

I've also given a rating of how critical/significant of a role blockchain plays.
(+) = optimizations, but would be possible even without blockchain
(++) = massive improvement, there's a possibility this might have never happened without blockchain
(+++) = blockchain is essential or has changed the meaning altogether.  We might not have even had the idea until blockchain came along.

* AI/Neural Networks (++)
* Massive Research Funding (+++)

### Evolution of Currency/Stores of Value

### Build/Maintain Wealth
* ICO's (+++)
* Angel Investing (+++)
* Alternate Wasy of Storing Value (ie art collections) (+)

### Power/Governance
* Self-Reliance (++)
* Unique Identity (++)
