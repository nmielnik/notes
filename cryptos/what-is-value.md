# What is the value of cryptocurrencies and blockchain?

## Questions that could be very similar in their answers
* What is the value of colleges/universities?
* What is the value of NASA?
* What is the value of the SIMs universe?
* What is the value of baseball card collecting?
* What is the value of the American Constitution?

## Examples of perception-alterting adoption
* The curing of critical disease (ie Alzheimers) or solving of a incredibly valuable problem that would have only been made possible by fund raising through blockchain and research through blockchain
* The creation of a massively successful alternate virtual universe (like SIMs but to a whole new level) where the participation in that world becomes something people could do full time (ie the Matrix)
* The end-to-end ICO, establishment, and significant revenue-producing success of multiple start-up companies
* A new government system, elections, and/or distribution of tax-payer money via blockchain
* Multiple success stories of ad-based businesses fully switching (and becoming more profitable) to mining-revenue from their customers, while still providing free services
* Multiple established companies abandoning the stake-holder, stock-based model of governance, and instead fully switching to a DAO-based approach to R&D, employees, etc.

### Other areas that there is likely a similar event
* An aspect of “collecting” in this too (like stamps, art, or baseball cards) but that part of it would never be enough to sustain it on its own (edited)
* Something around identity (like Civic) or authenticity (like WTC/VEN/WABI) but I haven’t been able to put it in a way that would make it soley reliant on blockchain and not possible with the tech we already have today

any one of those would establish clear, indisputable value in blockchain and really bitcoin and make it easier for the whole world to grasp

i think the probability of any one of those events isn’t super high, but what we’re betting on right now is that the probability of _at least one_ of those events is high
 
I also think the clock is ticking until one of those types of things happens, with the risk being a pretty huge collapse in value
 
because while there can be huge speculation for quite a while, a market based soley on speculation has similarities to a ponzi scheme in that it can collapse in rather massive ways quickly without any way to recover value.
