## Why Coaching Is Seriously Worth Trying...Seriously



## Why can't you just let me eat my lunch in peace?
* How many people here feel lost or confused about their future at Vistaprint?
  * (Hands Raise)
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->The goal is to help some of you have the means to address this tension
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Why does Nate care?
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" -->The recursive impact is awesome
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Everyone benefits as people succeed in sustainable, translatable ways



# Reasons to be skeptical
* Not clear how to get promoted, not clear why this helps
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Someone _has_ to be your manager, it's for the company not me
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->This doesn't address my compensation directly
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->I don't need someone telling me I have to change everything I do
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->I'm fine with what is already in place / don't want to send the wrong message by changing something
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Why do people not like crabs or coachees?
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" -->_Cuz they're shellfish_ (don't want to be selfish)
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->"Mentorship" / "Management" is awkard/unauthentic
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Don't want to agree/signal that someone is better at everything
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Don't want to have to do all the things they say I should do
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Don't want to have homework on top of my real work

# What is Coaching?
* Partnering with another person in a creative process that inspires their personal and professional growth.
* A coach guides through a process to help people come to their own conclusions
* A coach holds that people are naturally creative, resourceful, and whole
* A coach believes people are capable of finding answers to whatever challenges they face
* A coach believes that people are experts in their own lives
* A coach need not have any experience nor do they bring knowledge about the subject



# Reasons to Do it
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->"Are you solving the right problem?" (highly valuable programming skill)
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" -->_spending time formatting your NPE error message instead of fixing NPE_
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->"Rubber Duck Debugging"
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Focus: Do certain things really well instead of many things meh
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Vistaprint is big & has a lot of idiosyncracies...need help navigating them
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->Why only do collabroative problem solving for code?
* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->The _coach_ gets a lot out of this too


### What coaching ISN'T
* It isn't a grant of power & authority over people
* It's not about making coaches/mentor looks good or advancing their career because of power
* It's not about trusting someone to have all the answers
* It's not changing everything you do, it's better utilizing and understanding you're strenths, and at least being aware of things you could be better at



# Some Stories

# You can make it what you want
* It's a tool, not a requirement
  * You wouldn't just swear off hammers
* Examples:
  * Just talking about the 1 most interesting decision you will be making or made
  * Create weekly goals around things you actually care about and want to improve
  * Reflect to see if you're spending your time the way you actually want to
* It's likely ever coach-coachee relationship is different in what both parties get out of it, thus changing over time is important/valuable



# Stats
* We have ~18 (and growing) coaches in digital (out of 53 engineers) which has often increased as a result of helpful coaching and interest in doing it themselves
* 100% success rate of people saying they'd like to coach someone
* We've had at least 2 vocal skeptics who are now advocates, after giving it a chance
* 0 stories of negative outcomes from Mentor Connection convos (talking 15 minutes about your career to another human)



# Ending
* "Pairing" on more than just code, on your career
* Here's what you could try:
  * Be receptive to those who reach out about coaching
  * Try the Mentor Connection (reach out to someone to chat for 15 minutes)
    * Can get ideas of other people to talk to if it's not a good fit
  * Don't be afraid to switch coaches or have multiple coaches
  * Let Nate or someone else you trust schedule the convo for you
* Be open minded, what do you have to lose with so much to gain?
