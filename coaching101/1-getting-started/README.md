# Getting Started



## Investing In Someone
> "If you're worried about whether you're giving good advice or suggestions, you're doing just fine"

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->Genuinely caring about how someone is doing is the most important thing!
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->You'll put thought into what you say, and try to correct your own mistakes
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->Be their #1 fan & show you're invested, it will matter to them
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->**Active** vs **Passive** Coaching Mentality
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->**Investing Time** vs _Spending Time_
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->**Proactive** vs _Reactive_
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->**Push** vs _Pull_



## Setting Expectations
> What do you expect from a mentor or career coach?

* Provide feedback and discuss opportunities for growth
* Recognize and spread the word about achievements
* Help define goals and ways to accomplish them
* Sounding board for reflecting on past and upcoming decisions
* And many more...



## Agree on a 1:1 Schedule
* How Long / How Often
  * Try 1 hour / week to start (easier to dial back than to increase)
* Format / Itinerary
  * ie: 50% Last Week | 25% Next Week | 25% Long-Term
  * ie: 25% Team | 50% Leadership | 25% Personal
* How To Track Progress?
  * Goals? Feedback? Performance Eval?
  * Discuss each week vs. One-off assessments?


## DO NOT CANCEL 1:1's!
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->Set the tone & expectation that talking about their career matters!
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"-->Cancelling says: "I care more about this other thing than your career"
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"-->If you cancel a 1:1, there's a good chance they'll try to cancel them too
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4"-->Rescheduling is OK
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5"-->Coach should own the meeting invite
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5"-->Probably busier calendar + mentee has to ask to cancel
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6"-->Exceptions
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6"-->Week-Long PTO / Sick Time
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->Non-Exceptions
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->PTO/Sick on day of 1:1
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->Conference 


## Nate's 1:1 Schedule
1. What's happened with your team over the past week?
  * Dig into any accomplishments or areas of tension
2. What about outside your team (cross-team, leadership, coaching, etc.)?
3. Review previous goals + Create new goals
4. Anything you need answered or want to know more about?



## Write Things Down!
* Note-Taking
  * You'll get better and less awakard with practice
  * Encourages better listening
  * Great record keeping for progress + accomplishments
  * Goal setting
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->Collaborative Tools
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->Trello Board
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->Google Docs
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->Wunderlist
