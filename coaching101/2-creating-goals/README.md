# Creating Goals



# What are goals?

> the object of a person's ambition or effort; an aim or desired result.

* Not accomplishing a goal isn't a failure, it may not have been the right goal.


# Types of goals
* Lifetime vs long-term vs short-term vs stepping-stones
* 7 types: Career, Financial, Personal Development, Spiritual, Educational, Relationship, Physical/Health

* Nate's Types: Team/Org/Company Vision (Biz outcome), Personal Accomplishment (marathon), Personal Growth (new skill), Recognition (respect, promotion), ...



# SMART/MAT goals
* Specific
* **Measureable**
* **Achievable**
* Relevant
* **Time Bound**


## Example
* Do more code reviews
  * MAT: Do at least 2 code reviews for my teammates this week
* Ask more questions at meetings
  * MAT: Ask 3 or more questions at each of the 2 grooming meetings this week
* Meet with Grabthar for guidance
  * MAT: By tomorrow, have scheduled a 30 minute meeting with a volunteer from Grabthar

# Setting Regular Goals
* Ask about their previous week and take notes
* Dig into conflicts, opportunities, requests, questions, interests, or any other occurences or notes from the previous week(s) to find short-term goals
* Review previous goals to continue progress/momentum or reframe the goal if not completed
* Respond to feedback from others with goals


## Tips
* Save time for reviewing previous goals & creating new ones
* Store goals where it's convienient for mentor
  * Not just where it's convinient for you
* Make sure a long-term goal is addressed if possible
  * Help make it clear they're working towards something
* Make it measurable! Numbers are the best
  * At least X, try once, etc.
* Challenge them to create their own goals, ask questions!
  * ie: What's something you could do to address this situation in the next week?
* Use silence to encourage their own thinking and goal setting  
* Reference time-management exerecise or long-term goals


## My Own Rules
* Must have at least 2 goals each week
* Can carryover a goal at most once
  * If not completed twice, then the goal must change
* Can't be something you would have just done anyway if we hadn't talked about the goal



# Examples
* Break down a big goal of my ow



# Share Goals
* Sharing goals with peers & teammates can be powerful
  * Defines shared expectations
  * Raises feeling of accountability
  * Allows teammates to give feedback and help each other



# Let's Do It Live!
* Practice goal setting exerecise
