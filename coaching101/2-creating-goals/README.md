* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->Example: _Ask more questions at meetings_
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->_TIME_: Ask 3 or more questions at each of the 2 grooming meetings this week

  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->_TIME_: By tomorrow, have scheduled a 30 minute meeting with a volunteer from Grabthar



## Long-Term Goals
* 3 good questions from Talk 1: Getting Started:
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->_Who are 2 people that you admire?_
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->_What is one thing you want 1-year-from-now-you to be doing differently?_
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->_What is one thing you'd like to see change in the team/org/company that you can see yourself helping with?_



## Long-Term Goal Breakdown

### Example Goal:

<!-- .element class="highlighted" -->Every engineer in Vistaprint has at least 1 "invsted coach" they meet with regularly by January 2020


#### Example 1
* Every engineer in Vistaprint has at least 1 "invested coach" they meet with weekly by January 2020
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->We need a lot more coaches...how?
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->Investing in people usually leads to them investing in others
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->We've done this in Digital, will it work outside of digital?
  * <!-- .element class="fragment highlighted" data-fragment-index="4" -->GOAL: By the end of November, identify one person outside my teams that I'd like to try to coach


#### Example 2
* Every engineer in Vistaprint has at least 1 "invested coach" they meet with weekly by January 2020
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->How can we raise awareness?
  *  <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->Have folks share stories about their experience
  *  <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->How can I make people more comfortable with sharing their stories and not just share mine?
  *  <!-- .element class="fragment highlighted" data-fragment-index="4" -->GOAL: Within a month, have done 2 story-sharing talks with a 3rd scheduled to be done by another person



## Setting Regular Goals
* Ask about their week + take notes
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->Dig into conflicts, opportunities, requests, questions, interests
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->Almost always a good TIME goal for these
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->Review previous goals and either build on top of or reframe
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->Address peer feedback + new opportunities
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->Delegation
  * <!-- .element class="fragment highlighted" data-fragment-index="6" -->Challenge: Ask people to do the things you value the most instead of what you value the least


### Tips For Goal Setting
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->In 1:1's: make time for reviewing previous goals & creating new ones
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->Store goals where it's convienient for mentee / coachee _(Not just where it's convienient for you)_
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->See if they have their own time management / goal app and use that
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->Make sure there's at least one goal aligned to long-term goals
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->We're working towards something here, not just creating busy work!


### ...Tips For Goal Setting
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->Make it measurable! Numbers are the best
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->At least X, try once, etc.
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->Challenge them to create their own goals first, ask questions!
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->ie: What's something you could do to address this situation in the next week?
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->Silence is golden!
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->The longer you wait in silence the deeper they'll dig for ideas for goals they care about.
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->Look at result of Time Prioritization Exercise or from previous talk on "Getting Started"


### Nate's Rules
* Must have at least 2 goals each week
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->Can carryover a goal at most once
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->If not completed after 2 x 1:1's, then the goal must change
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->Can't be something you would have just done anyway if we hadn't talked about the goal
